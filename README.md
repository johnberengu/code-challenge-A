### CALCULATE GRADE GENERATOR.
## Overview
This JavaScript program calculates the grade of a student based on their marks. It takes a student's mark as input (within the range of 0-100) and assigns a grade according to predefined criteria.

# How the Function Works
The function studentMarks evaluates the student's marks and returns a grade based on the following scale:

Marks Range	Grade
80 - 100	A
60 - 79	B
50 - 59	C
40 - 49	D
0 - 39	E
If the input mark is not in the valid range (0-100), the function will return "invalid score".
